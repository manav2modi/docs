## Phone Numbers

Phone numbers are the gateway for receiving SMS messages and voice calls. Each number can be assigned to an agent and will receive all inbound communications.

## Create a Phone Number

**POST** `/v1/numbers`

Provision a new SMS-enabled phone number. Optionally assign it to an agent.

<Warning>
  Each project has a lifetime limit of 5 phone numbers (including released numbers). If you've reached this limit, you'll receive a validation error.
</Warning>
