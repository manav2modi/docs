## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<CodeGroup>
```bash Example request
curl -X GET https://api.agentphone.dev/v1/numbers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secret** - Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables to store your keys securely.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Key

You can get your API key by creating a project in the dashboard. The API key is shown once during project creation, so make sure to save it securely.

## Using Environment Variables

Store your API key in an environment variable:

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env
AGENT_PHONE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```javascript JavaScript
const API_KEY = process.env.AGENT_PHONE_API_KEY;
```

```python Python
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get('AGENT_PHONE_API_KEY')
```
</CodeGroup>
