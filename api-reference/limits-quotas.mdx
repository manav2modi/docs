## Phone Number Limits

Each project has a **lifetime limit** on the number of phone numbers that can be created. This limit includes both active and released numbers.

<Card title="Current Limit" icon="phone">
  **5 numbers per project** - Lifetime limit (includes released numbers)
</Card>

<Warning>
  If you reach your limit, you'll receive a validation error when attempting to create a new number. To create more numbers, please upgrade your plan or contact support.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage and system stability. Rate limits vary by endpoint based on the operation's cost and complexity.

### Rate Limits by Endpoint

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `POST /v1/numbers` | 5 per hour |
| `DELETE /v1/numbers/:id` | 10 per hour |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` | 100 per hour |
| `POST /v1/webhooks/test` | 60 per hour |
| `GET /v1/numbers` | 1000 per minute |
| `GET /v1/numbers/:id/messages` | 100 per minute |
| `GET /v1/conversations` | 100 per minute |
| All other endpoints | 100 per minute (default) |

### Rate Limit Headers

When you exceed a rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following headers:

- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before retrying
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in window

<CodeGroup>
```json Rate Limit Exceeded Response
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Limit: 5 requests per 3600s",
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "type": "rate_limit_error"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Always implement exponential backoff when retrying after rate limit errors. See the [Error Handling](/api-reference/error-handling) guide for best practices.
