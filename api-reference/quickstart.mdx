## Quick Start

Get up and running with the agent-first approach in under 2 minutes:

### Step 1: Get your API key

<Card title="Create a project" icon="plus" href="/setup">
  Create a project to get your API key, or use the one you already have.
</Card>

### Step 2: Create an agent

Create an AI agent that will handle your phone interactions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agentphone.dev/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Support Bot", "description": "Handles customer support"}'
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Response
{
  "id": "agent_123",
  "name": "Support Bot",
  "description": "Handles customer support",
  "createdAt": "2025-12-03T10:00:00Z",
  "numbers": []
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Give it a phone number

Provision a phone number for your agent:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agentphone.dev/v1/numbers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"country": "US", "agentId": "agent_123"}'
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Response
{
  "id": "clx123abc",
  "phoneNumber": "+18571234567",
  "country": "US",
  "status": "active",
  "agentId": "agent_123",
  "createdAt": "2025-12-03T10:00:00Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Connect your agent brain

Register a webhook to receive messages and voice transcripts:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agentphone.dev/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-server.com/webhook"}'
```

<CodeGroup>
```json Response
{
  "id": "wh_abc123",
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
  "secret": "whsec_xyz...",
  "status": "active",
  "contextLimit": 10,
  "createdAt": "2025-12-03T10:00:00Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 5: Handle agent.message events with context

When someone texts or calls your number, you'll receive an `agent.message` event with full conversation context:

<CodeGroup>
```json Incoming webhook payload
{
  "event": "agent.message",
  "channel": "sms",  // or "voice"
  "agentId": "agent_123",
  "data": {
    "conversationId": "conv_abc",
    "from": "+14155551234",
    "to": "+18571234567",
    "message": "Hey, I need help!",
    "direction": "inbound"
  },
  "conversationState": { "customerName": "John" },  // Your stored metadata
  "recentHistory": [  // Last 10 messages for AI context
    { "content": "Previous message", "direction": "inbound", "channel": "sms", "at": "..." }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  For voice calls, your webhook must return JSON with a `text` field that will be spoken to the caller. See the [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) section for details.
